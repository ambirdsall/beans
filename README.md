Me too! And it feels so good to do coffee properly. To use decent beans, freshly ground,
with the right amount of water at the right temperature. But, shit, wait, what

# A HA!
## UH, ABOUT 16:1 WATER-TO-GROUNDS

Sweet! But tedious. And now I have to go ahead and multiply by an awkward

don't want anyone's feelings to get hurt.
